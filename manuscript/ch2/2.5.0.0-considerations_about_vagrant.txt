## Some considerations about Vagrant

### Same result

As you can see, it doesn't matter which way you choose (Packer or Vagrant Cloud) you end up with the same result.

### Vagrantfile position

I want also to stress on something that you probably have already noticed: all the Vagrant commands are anticipated by this command:

{linenos=off, lang=bash}
~~~~~~~
cd $pve/ariadne/orchestration/vagrant
~~~~~~~

This is because Vagrant expects to find the Vagrantfile in the directory from which you are typing the commands.

### The .vagrant directory

Now that the Vagrant virtual machine has been created you can see a new hidden directory `$pve/ariadne/orchestration/vagrant/.vagrant`

{linenos=off, lang=bash}
~~~~~~~
tree $pve/ariadne/orchestration/vagrant/.vagrant
.
└── machines
    └── ariadne-dev
        └── virtualbox
            ├── action_provision
            ├── action_set_name
            ├── id
            ├── index_uuid
            └── synced_folders
~~~~~~~

In this directory Vagrant saves important information about the newly created vm. 

T> Don't delete the .vagrant folder!

### start and stop a vm

If you want to stop or reboot the development virtual machine from your workstation terminal, be sure to be in the `vagrant` directory and then run:

{linenos=off, lang=bash}
~~~~~~~
vagrant halt
~~~~~~~

or

{linenos=off, lang=bash}
~~~~~~~
vagrant reload
~~~~~~~

To start the development virtual machine after you stop it:

{linenos=off, lang=bash}
~~~~~~~
vagrant up
~~~~~~~
