## Some considerations about Vagrant

### Same result

As you can see, doesn't matter which one of the ways to build the Vagrant vm you picked (Packer or Vagrant Cloud) you end up with the same result.

### Vagrantfile position

I want also stress on something that you probably have already noticed: all the Vagrant commands are anticipated by a:

{linenos=off, lang=bash}
~~~~~~~
cd $pve/ariadne/orchestration/vagrant
~~~~~~~

This is because Vagrant expects to find the Vagrantfile in the directory from which you are running the commands.

### .vagrant directory

Now that the Vagrant vm has been created you'll notice a new hidden directory `$pve/ariadne/orchestration/vagrant/.vagrant`

{linenos=off, lang=bash}
~~~~~~~
tree $pve/ariadne/orchestration/vagrant/.vagrant
.
└── machines
    └── ariadne-dev
        └── virtualbox
            ├── action_provision
            ├── action_set_name
            ├── id
            ├── index_uuid
            └── synced_folders
~~~~~~~

In this directory Vagrant saves important information about the newly created vm. **Don't delete it**.

### start and stop a vm

If you want to stop or reboot the development vm from your workstation terminal, be sure to be in the vagrant directory and then run:

{linenos=off, lang=bash}
~~~~~~~
vagrant halt
~~~~~~~

or

{linenos=off, lang=bash}
~~~~~~~
vagrant reload
~~~~~~~

To start the development vm after you stop it:

{linenos=off, lang=bash}
~~~~~~~
vagrant up
~~~~~~~
