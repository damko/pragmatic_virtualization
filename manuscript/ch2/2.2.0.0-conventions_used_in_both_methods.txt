## Conventions used in both methods

Before starting, some conventions used by the manual in both the methods.

_Ariadne_ will be the arbitrary _root name_ used to label the Vagrant virtual machines generated starting from the Vagrant template: i.e. the development machine will be named _ariadne-dev_ and the production one _ariadne-prod_.

In the both the _extra_ branches there is a directory called _ariadne_ having this structure:

    ├── orchestration
    │   └── vagrant
    └── projects

This is an arbitrary skeleton and has this meaning:
* the _orchestration_ directory contains what's needed for the management of the vms
* the _projects_ directory contains the source code shared with the virtual machine.

You can change this schema as you like as far as you provide somewhere a valid Vagrantfile and a directory to host the code.
