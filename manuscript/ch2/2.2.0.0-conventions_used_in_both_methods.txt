## Conventions used in both methods

Before starting, there are some conventions used for both methods.

_Ariadne_ will be the arbitrary _root name_ used to label the Vagrant virtual machines generated starting from the Vagrant template.

This means that the development machine will be named _ariadne-dev_ and the production one _ariadne-prod_.

In the both the _extra_ branches there is a directory called _ariadne_ having this structure:

{linenos=off, lang=text}
~~~~~~~
├── orchestration
│   └── vagrant
└── projects
~~~~~~~

This is an arbitrary skeleton and has this meaning:

the _orchestration_ directory:

: it's the "virtualization" directory and it contains what's needed for the management of the vms.


the _projects_ directory:

: it contains the source code shared with the virtual machine.

In the future you can change this structure as you like as far as you place somewhere a valid Vagrantfile and a directory to host the code but, for now, I strongly suggest you to keep it as it is.
