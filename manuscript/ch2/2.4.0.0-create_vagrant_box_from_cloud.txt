## Create a Vagrant template box from Vagrant Cloud

Checkout the _create_vagrant_box_from_cloud_ branch from the _extra_ repository

{linenos=off, lang=bash}
~~~~~~~
cd $pve
git checkout create_vagrant_box_from_cloud
~~~~~~~

What has been made with Packer can be done with [Vagrant Cloud](http://vagrantcloud.com/). If you look for "Debian Jessie" in the "Discover Boxes" section you'll get many results: the first one that I have found claiming to produce a clean and minimal Debian Jessie 64 bit is the ARCO Research Group [deb/jessie-amd64](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/deb/boxes/jessie-amd64)

To use this box run:

{linenos=off, lang=bash}
~~~~~~~
cd $pve/ariadne/orchestration/vagrant
vagrant init deb/jessie-amd64 --provider virtualbox
~~~~~~~

Output:

{linenos=off, lang=bash}
~~~~~~~
A `Vagrantfile` has been placed in this directory. You are now
ready to `vagrant up` your first virtual environment! Please read
the comments in the Vagrantfile as well as documentation on
`vagrantup.com` for more information on using Vagrant
~~~~~~~

This command creates a Vagrantfile which, leaving out the comments, looks like this:

{linenos=on, lang=text}
~~~~~~~
VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION = "2"

Vagrant.configure(VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION) do |config|

  config.vm.box = "xezpeleta/wheezy64"

end
~~~~~~~

If you know want to have the same virtual machine as the previous chapter (same RAM, cores, name etc.) you should replace the Vagrantfile with the one provided in the extra and be sure that there is no other `ariadne-dev` VirtualBox machine.

T> You can check your virtual machines list by running the command `virtualbox`

{linenos=off, lang=bash}
~~~~~~~
cd $pve/ariadne/orchestration/vagrant
mv Vagrantfile_custom Vagrantfile
~~~~~~~

The only extra step that you need to do is:

{linenos=off, lang=bash}
~~~~~~~
cd $pve/ariadne/orchestration/vagrant
vagrant up
~~~~~~~

Output:

{linenos=off, lang=bash}
~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~

The `vagrant up` command downloads the box, stores it in your hard drive, makes it available for VirtualBox and then, finally, orders to VirtualBox to create a virtual machine by cloning the downloaded box and you end up with the working virtual machine. Brilliant!

That's it. The virtual machine is ready and running.

You can now login in the virtual machine via ssh with:

{linenos=off, lang=bash}
~~~~~~~
cd $pve/ariadne/orchestration/vagrant
vagrant ssh
