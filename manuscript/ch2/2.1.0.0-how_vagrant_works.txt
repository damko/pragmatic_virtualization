## How Vagrant works

You already know that Vagrant acts as a wrapper for VirtualBox (or any other supported virtualization system).
This means that when you give a command to Vagrant it will route the command to the virtualization system.

For instance when you can ask Vagrant to create a new virtual machine it means that Vagrant will ask VirtualBox to create it.

The virtualization system can not create a virtual machine out of thin air because, as you can imagine, you need to install the operating system as much as you do when you want to install an operating system on an empty hard-drive.

To solve this problem Vagrant uses _boxes_ which can be considered as _template virtual machines_ that are given to VirtualBox so that it can clone "real" virtual machines from them.

If you are thinking that this solution just moves the problem from VirtualBox to Vagrant you are right. Something still has to create the _boxes_.

How are Vagrant "boxes" created?

In two ways:

1. they can be created from scratch by Packer, starting from an iso file (it can be any distribution you like)
1. they can be downloaded from the [Vagrant Cloud website](http://vagrantcloud.com)

Vagrant Cloud is a great solution: it's simple, quick and saves you a lot of time.
Basically Vagrant Cloud lists boxes created by other people who have decided to share them publicly.

You go on the Vagrant Cloud website, look for the operating system that you need, run few commands on the terminal and Vagrant takes care of everything (see section 2.4).

Perfect, isn't it? Well, it depends.

What if you don't trust the downloaded boxes?
What if need a Linux distro not listed in Vagrant Cloud?

In these cases you have no other choice than creating your own box.

Section 2.3 will show how to create a Vagrant box using Packer starting from an iso file but, if you prefer to use Vagrant Cloud, you can move straight to section 2.4.
