## Dive deeper into virtualization

The manual is almost over. I tried to share all I could and, by now, it should be pretty clear that virtualization is a huge and charming change in the computing world.

It's such a vast field that a new professional figure, the _devops engineer_, has born and the job offers are growing rapidly.

If you want to learn more about virtualization there are many books available for many different virtualization technologies.

I highly suggest to start with [Vagrant CookBook](https://leanpub.com/vagrantcookbook) written by [Erika Heidi](https://twitter.com/erikaheidi), honestly, one of the clearest book I have ever read. 

She efficiently explains what are the differences between Ansible, Puppet and Chef and this helped me a lot in choosing Ansible as my favorite automation tool. 

She also provides some valuable tricks and many recipes for all the three provisioning systems that will help you to speed up your learning process.
