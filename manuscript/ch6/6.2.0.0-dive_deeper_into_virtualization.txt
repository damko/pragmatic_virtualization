## Know more about virtualization

It should be pretty clear that virtualization is a huge and charming change in the computing world but it's such a vast field that a new professional figure, the _devops engineer_, has developed and the demand is growing rapidly.

This manual provides just the minimum knowledge required to a developer but it doesn't make the reader a devops engineer.

If you want to learn more about virtualization there are many books available not only on Vagrant but also on other technologies like Docker.

Personally I highly suggest the [Vagrant CookBook](https://leanpub.com/vagrantcookbook) written by [Erika Heidi](https://twitter.com/erikaheidi), one of the clearest book I have ever read. She efficiently explains what are the differences between Ansible, Puppet and Chef and provides some Vagrant tricks and many recipes for all the three provisioning systems.
