## Get ready

This manual is hosted by 2 github repositories:

* [the source](https://github.com/damko/pragmatic_virtualization)
* [the extra](https://github.com/damko/pragmatic_virtualization_extra)

The _extra_ repository is very important because it contains all you need to follow each chapter of this manual. Forget copy and paste, it won't be necessary most of the time.

To download and use the _extra_ repository you need to have [Git](http://git-scm.com/) installed in your system and a [Github](http://github.com) account.

If Git is not yet installed in your system install it with:

    sudo apt-get install git git-core

Download the _extra_ repository with:

    git clone git@github.com:damko/pragmatic_virtualization_extra.git

This will create the "pragmatic_virtualization_extra" subdirectory

In the manual I'll refer to this directory's path as `$pve` so it's convenient to save this variable in your bash environment by doing:

    cd pragmatic_virtualization_extra
    pve=$(pwd)

The _extra_ repository has branches bind to the manual content and, chapter by chapter, the manual will provide the branch name to use.

You can synchronize your local content with this command:

    git checkout <branch_name>
