## Final considerations

As you can see, doesn't matter which one of the ways to build the Vagrant vm you picked (Packer or Vagrant Cloud) you end up with the same result.

I want also stress on something that you probably have already noticed: all the Vagrant commands are anticipated by a:

    cd $pve/ariadne/orchestration/vagrant

This is because Vagrant expects to find the Vagrantfile in the directory from which you are running the commands.
