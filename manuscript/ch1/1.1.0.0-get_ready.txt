## Get ready

This manual is split in two parts each one hosted in a Github repositories:

* [the content](https://github.com/damko/pragmatic_virtualization)
* [the extra](https://github.com/damko/pragmatic_virtualization_extra)

The content is of course the manual itself. It's publicly available and you can fork and reuse it.

The _extra_ repository is as much important as the content because it contains all you need (scripts, directories, configuration files etc) to follow the manual instructions.

The _extra_ repository [branches](https://github.com/damko/pragmatic_virtualization_extra/branches/all), in fact, are bound to the manual chapters, and chapter by chapter, you will be told which branch name you should use.

To download and use the _extra_ repository you need to have [Git](http://git-scm.com/) installed in your system and a [Github](http://github.com) account.

If Git is not yet installed in your system, open a terminal and install it type this command:

{linenos=off, lang="text"}

    sudo apt-get install git git-core

Once Git is installed you are ready to download the _extra_ repository:

{linenos=off, lang="bash"}
    cd `your-favorite-directory`
    git clone git@github.com:damko/pragmatic_virtualization_extra.git

This will create the `pragmatic_virtualization_extra` subdirectory inside `your-favorite-directory`.

From now on I will refer to this directory path as `$pve` so it's convenient for you to save the `$pve` variable in your bash environment by doing:

{lang="text"}
{linenos=off}
    cd pragmatic_virtualization_extra
    pve=$(pwd)

In this way by typing `cd $pve` in your terminal you will be brought in the `pragmatic_virtualization_extra` directory.

T> You should run this last command any time you open a new terminal or after a reboot.

Now that you have your _extra_ on the hard drive you can switch to the specific branch in use with this command:

{linenos=off}{lang="bash"}
    git checkout _branch-name_

where _branch-name_ is given chapter by chapter.
