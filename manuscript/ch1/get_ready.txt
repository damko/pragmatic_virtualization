## Get ready

This manual is split in two parts each one hosted in a github repositories:

* [the source](https://github.com/damko/pragmatic_virtualization)
* [the extra](https://github.com/damko/pragmatic_virtualization_extra)

The _extra_ repository is very important because it contains all you need to follow each chapter of this manual.

Forget copy and paste, it will not be necessary in most of the chances. The _extra_ repository branches are bound to the manual content and, chapter by chapter, the manual will provide the branch name to use.

To download and use the _extra_ repository you need to have [Git](http://git-scm.com/) installed in your system and a [Github](http://github.com) account.

If Git is not yet installed in your system install it with:

{linenos=off}
    sudo apt-get install git git-core

Then download the _extra_ repository with:

{linenos=off}
    git clone git@github.com:damko/pragmatic_virtualization_extra.git

This will create the "pragmatic_virtualization_extra" subdirectory inside your current directory.

Along the manual I'll refer to this directory path as `$pve` so it's convenient to save this variable in your bash environment by doing:

    cd pragmatic_virtualization_extra
    pve=$(pwd)

You should run this last command any time you open a new terminal or after a reboot.

You can change the current branch in use with this command:

{linenos=off}
    git checkout <branch_name>

where _branch_name_ is given chapter by chapter.
