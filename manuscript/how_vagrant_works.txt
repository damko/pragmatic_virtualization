## How Vagrant works

You already know that Vagrant acts as a wrapper for VirtualBox (or any other supported virtualization environment).
This means that when you give a command to Vagrant it will route the command to the virtualization environment.

Among many other things, you can ask Vagrant to create a new virtual machine but this means that Vagrant will ask VirtualBox to create it.

No virtualization system can create a virtual machine out of nothing because, as you can imagine, you need to install the operating system as much as you do when you want to install an operating system on an empty hard-drive.

To solve this problem Vagrant uses "boxes" which can be considered as "template" virtual machines that are given to VirtualBox and from which VirtualBox can clone a "real" virtual machine.

You might think that this solution just moves the problem from VirtualBox to Vagrant and ... you are right ... something still has to create the boxes.

How are Vagrant "boxes" created? In two ways:

1. they can be created by Packer starting from an iso file
1. they can be downloaded from the [Vagrant Cloud website](http://vagrantcloud.com)

Vagrant Cloud is a great solution. It's simple, quick and saves you a lot of time.

Basically Vagrant Cloud lists boxes created by other people who have decided to share them publicly. You go on the website, look for the operating system that you need, run few commands on the terminal and Vagrant takes care of everything (see later).

Perfect, isn't it? Well, it depends.

What if you don't trust the downloaded boxes?
What if need a Linux distro not listed in Vagrant Cloud?

In these cases you have no other choice than creating your own box.

The next paragraph will show how to create a Vagrant box using Packer starting from an iso file but if you prefer to use Vagrant Cloud you can skip it and move to the next one.
