## Ansible

Ansible is a powerful automation tool that doesn't require custom scripting or custom code. No agents. Its simple configuration syntax and the ability to execute commands via ssh without a custom agent make Ansible a very appealing tool.

### Ansible installation

Ansible must be installed on the workstation and this time it can be done using the distro


    sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
    sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install ansible

Once Ansible is installed, it will not add a database, and there will be no daemons to start or keep running. You only need to install it on the workstation and it can manage an entire fleet of remote machines from that central point.

This command is not mandatory but will remove the funny "cow"

                    ||----w |
                    ||     ||

from the Ansible output

    sudo sed 's/#nocows/nocows/g' -i /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg


### Ansible and Vagrant

Checkout the _ansible_apache_mysql_php_ branch of the _extra_ repository

    cd $pve
    git checkout ansible_apache_mysql_php

Vagrant can be configured to be a wrapper also for Ansible. To do so the Vagrantfile has to contain these instructions:

    # Use Ansible as automation tool
    devel.vm.provision "ansible" do |ansible|

        ansible.playbook = "../ansible/ariadne-dev-playbook.yml"

        # Run commands as root
        ansible.sudo = true
    end

The only variable to take care of is _ansible.playbook_ which says where Ansible can find the configuration file.
