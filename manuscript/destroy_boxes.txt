## Destroy your development vm

### How to identify the correct vm

Before destroying a box it's important to know the box identification name so that you specify which the one to delete.

Currently we have the Vagrant/Virtualbox "development" vm and the Vagrant "template" box.

The Vagrant template vm and the Vagrant vm have different names and they are written in the Vagrantfile:

    # Vagrant template box name
    VG_BOX_NAME = "debian_wheezy_770_64bit"

    # Local virtual machine for development
    VB_DEV_VM_NAME = "ariadne-dev"


### Destroy the Vagrant development vm

Vagrant can be used to destroy the newly created _ariadne-dev_ but the machine must be listed in the Vagrantfile. You can not destroy any vm you like.

    cd $pve/ariadne/orchestration/vagrant/
    vagrant destroy ariadne-dev

Output:

    ariadne-dev: Are you sure you want to destroy the 'ariadne-dev' VM? [y/N]
    ==> ariadne-dev: Forcing shutdown of VM...
    ==> ariadne-dev: Destroying VM and associated drives...

If you run again:

    vboxmanage list vms

or

    vagrant global-status

you should not see _ariadne-dev_ anymore.

If you try to destroy a vm that is not listed in the Vagrantfile, like this

    vagrant destroy precise64_default_1396556373306_80830

you get

    The machine with the name 'precise64_default_1396556373306_80830' was not found configured for this Vagrant environment.

### Destroy the Vagrant template box

One day the Vagrant template box will become outdated and you might want to delete it. This is the command

    vagrant box remove debian_wheezy_770_64bit

and it can be executed from any directory because it doesn't need the Vagrantfile.

Output:

    Removing box 'debian_wheezy_770_64bit' (v0) with provider 'virtualbox'...

Run again:

    vagrant box list

Now you should not see debian_wheezy_770_64bit in the list.

T> After deleting a Vagrant box don't forget to go through every single Vagrantfile and update the _VG_BOX_NAME_ variable with the new template name.
