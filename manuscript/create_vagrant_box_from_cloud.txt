## Create a Vagrant Template box from Vagrant Cloud

What has been made with Packer can be done with [Vagrant Cloud](http://vagrantcloud.com/). If you look for "Debian Wheezy" in the "Discover Boxes" section you'll get many results: the first one that I've found claiming to produce a clean Debian Wheezy without any additional package installed is [xezpeleta/wheezy64](https://vagrantcloud.com/xezpeleta/boxes/wheezy64)

To use this box run:

    vagrant init xezpeleta/wheezy64

Output:

    A `Vagrantfile` has been placed in this directory. You are now
    ready to `vagrant up` your first virtual environment! Please read
    the comments in the Vagrantfile as well as documentation on
    `vagrantup.com` for more information on using Vagrant

This command creates just a Vagrantfile which, without comments, looks like this:

    VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION = "2"

    Vagrant.configure(VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION) do |config|

      config.vm.box = "xezpeleta/wheezy64"

    end

The only extra step that you need to have to do is:

    vagrant up

Output:

    Bringing machine 'default' up with 'virtualbox' provider...
    ==> default: Box 'xezpeleta/wheezy64' could not be found. Attempting to find and install...
        default: Box Provider: virtualbox
        default: Box Version: >= 0
    ==> default: Loading metadata for box 'xezpeleta/wheezy64'
        default: URL: https://vagrantcloud.com/xezpeleta/wheezy64
    ==> default: Adding box 'xezpeleta/wheezy64' (v1.0.0) for provider: virtualbox
        default: Downloading: https://vagrantcloud.com/xezpeleta/boxes/wheezy64/versions/1/providers/virtualbox.box
        default: Progress: 1% (Rate: 495k/s, Estimated time remaining: 0:16:08)

    [...]

    ==> default: Successfully added box 'xezpeleta/wheezy64' (v1.0.0) for 'virtualbox'!
    ==> default: Importing base box 'xezpeleta/wheezy64'...

    [...]

    ==> default: Machine booted and ready!

The `vagrant up` command downloads the box, stores it in your hard drive, makes it available for Virtualbox and then, finally, orders to Virtualbox to create a virtual machine by cloning the downloaded box and you end up with the working virtual machine. Brilliant!

That's it. The virtual machine is ready and runnig.

You can now login in the Virtualbox vm with

    cd $pve/ariadne/orchestration/vagrant
    vagrant ssh
