## Rebuild the Vagrant virtual machine

Once you have a well configured Vagrantfile and a ready Vagrant template box all you need to do to rebuild you Vagrant virtual machine is to run 

{linenos=off, lang=bash}
~~~~~~~
vagrant up
~~~~~~~

## How to build another copy

If you want to create a clone of _ariadne_ you just need to copy the Vagrantfile in another directory and modify its variables

{linenos=off, lang=text}
~~~~~~~
VB_DEV_VM_NAME = "newvm-dev"
VB_DEV_VM_IP = "192.168.51.xx"
~~~~~~~
then run `vagrant up`. That's it.
