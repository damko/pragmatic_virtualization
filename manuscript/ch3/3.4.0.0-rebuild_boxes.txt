## Rebuild the Vagrant development vm

Once you have a well configured Vagrantfile and a ready Vagrant template you just need to run `vagrant up` to rebuild the whole machine. This should be pretty clear already.

## How to build another copy

If you want to create another virtual machine equal to _ariadne_ you just need to copy the Vagrantfile in another directory and modify its variables

    VB_DEV_VM_NAME = "newvm-dev"
    VB_DEV_VM_IP = "192.168.51.xx"

and run `vagrant up`. That's it.
