## Destroy your virtual machine

I told you that virtualization is a great thing because you can easily create, destroy and rebuild a virtual machine with basically no effort.

Let's prove it by destroying and then rebuilding the virtual machine.

### How to identify the correct virtual machine

Before destroying a virtual machine it's important to know its identification name so that you can be sure that you are deleting the right one.

Currently we have the Vagrant/VirtualBox virtual machine and the Vagrant template box and they have different names that are written in the Vagrantfile:

{linenos=off, lang=ruby}
~~~~~~~
# Vagrant template box name
VG_BOX_NAME = "debian_jessie_800_64bit"

# Local virtual machine for development
VB_DEV_VM_NAME = "ariadne-dev"
~~~~~~~

### Destroy the Vagrant virtual machine

Vagrant can be used to destroy the newly created _ariadne-dev_

T> The virtual machine to destroy must be defined in the Vagrantfile present in the current directory

{linenos=off, lang=bash}
~~~~~~~
cd $pve/ariadne/orchestration/vagrant/
vagrant destroy ariadne-dev
~~~~~~~

Output:

{linenos=off, lang=text}
~~~~~~~
    ariadne-dev: Are you sure you want to destroy the 'ariadne-dev' VM? [y/N]
    ==> ariadne-dev: Forcing shutdown of VM...
    ==> ariadne-dev: Destroying VM and associated drives...
~~~~~~~

If you run again:

{linenos=off, lang=bash}
~~~~~~~
vboxmanage list vms
~~~~~~~

or

{linenos=off, lang=bash}
~~~~~~~
vagrant global-status
~~~~~~~

you should not see _ariadne-dev_ anymore.

If you try to destroy a virtual machine that is not listed in the Vagrantfile, like this

{linenos=off, lang=bash}
~~~~~~~
vagrant destroy precise64_default_1396556373306_80830
~~~~~~~

you get

{linenos=off, lang=text}
~~~~~~~
The machine with the name 'precise64_default_1396556373306_80830' was not found configured for this Vagrant environment.
~~~~~~~

### Destroy the Vagrant template box

One day the Vagrant template box will become outdated and you might want to delete it to replace it with a new one.

{linenos=off, lang=bash}
~~~~~~~
vagrant box remove debian_jessie_800_64bit
~~~~~~~

This command can be executed from any directory because it doesn't need the Vagrantfile.

Output:

{linenos=off, lang=text}
~~~~~~~
Removing box 'debian_jessie_800_64bit' (v0) with provider 'virtualbox'...
~~~~~~~

Run again:

{linenos=off, lang=bash}
~~~~~~~
vagrant box list
~~~~~~~

Now you should not see debian_jessie_800_64bit in the list.

T> After deleting a Vagrant template box don't forget to go through every single Vagrantfile and update the _VG_BOX_NAME_ variable with the new template name.
