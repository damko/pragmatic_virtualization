## Listing virtual machines

It should be clear by now that Vagrant is a virtual machine manager therefore there are a number of commands that you can run to handle your vagrant virtual machines:

{linenos=off, lang=bash}
~~~~~~~
    vagrant -h
~~~~~~~

Output:

{linenos=off, lang=text}
~~~~~~~
    Usage: vagrant [options] <command> [<args>]

        -v, --version                    Print the version and exit.
        -h, --help                       Print this help.

    Common commands:
         box             manages boxes: installation, removal, etc.
         connect         connect to a remotely shared Vagrant environment
         destroy         stops and deletes all traces of the vagrant machine
         global-status   outputs status Vagrant environments for this user
         halt            stops the vagrant machine
         help            shows the help for a subcommand
         hostsupdater    
         init            initializes a new Vagrant environment by creating a Vagrantfile
         login           log in to HashiCorp's Atlas
         package         packages a running vagrant environment into a box
         plugin          manages plugins: install, uninstall, update, etc.
         provision       provisions the vagrant machine
         push            deploys code in this environment to a configured destination
         rdp             connects to machine via RDP
         rebuild         
         reload          restarts vagrant machine, loads new Vagrantfile configuration
         resume          resume a suspended vagrant machine
         share           share your Vagrant environment with anyone in the world
         ssh             connects to machine via SSH
         ssh-config      outputs OpenSSH valid configuration to connect to the machine
         status          outputs status of the vagrant machine
         suspend         suspends the machine
         up              starts and provisions the vagrant environment
         vbguest         
         version         prints current and latest Vagrant version

    For help on any individual command run `vagrant COMMAND -h`

    Additional subcommands are available, but are either more advanced
    or not commonly used. To see all subcommands, run the command
    `vagrant list-commands`.

For instance you can list the Vagrant templates (or _boxes_) with this:

{linenos=off, lang=bash}
~~~~~~~
    vagrant box list
~~~~~~~

You should see something like:

{linenos=off, lang=text}
~~~~~~~
    deb/jessie-amd64        (virtualbox, 2.0)
    debian_jessie_800_64bit (virtualbox, 0)
~~~~~~~

You can also list the Vagrant vms managed by Vagrant with:

{linenos=off, lang=bash}
~~~~~~~
    vagrant global-status
~~~~~~~

Output:

{linenos=off, lang=bash}
~~~~~~~
    4c47439  ariadne-dev virtualbox    running  /home/damko/projects/pragmatic_virtualization_extra/ariadne/orchestration/vagrant
~~~~~~~

You can also ask VirtualBox to list the virtual machines present in its registry.

{linenos=off, lang=bash}
~~~~~~~
    vboxmanage list vms
~~~~~~~

Output:

{linenos=off, lang=bash}
~~~~~~~
    "ariadne-dev" {472a10a0-6958-4e62-9219-54d50bee4928}
~~~~~~~

I> The output of the last two commands (`vagrant global-status` and `vboxmanage list vms`) is the same (_ariadne-dev_ for both) but this is just a coincidence. There is no equivalence between the two commands.

If you prefer you can use the VirtualBox GUI to list the register vms and to deal with them:

{linenos=off, lang=bash}
~~~~~~~
    virtualbox
~~~~~~~

T> If you need to destroy a virtual machine made with Vagrant it's better to use the command `vagrant destroy` than to delete the virtual machine from the VirtualBox interface. The `vagrant destroy`, in fact, will deal with the `.vagrant` folder and it will update its content and keep it clean. VirtualBox obviously will not.

### Where are your templates and vms?

The Vagrant template boxes are located on your workstation hard-disk

{linenos=off, lang=bash}
~~~~~~~
    ls -lh ~/.vagrant.d/boxes
~~~~~~~

Output:

{linenos=off, lang=bash}
~~~~~~~
    drwxr-xr-x 3 damko damko 4.0K 2014-11-17 20:27:33 debian_jessie_800_64bit
~~~~~~~

You can check the occupied space with:

{linenos=off, lang=bash}
~~~~~~~
    du -sh ~/.vagrant.d/boxes/*
~~~~~~~

Output:

{linenos=off, lang=bash}
~~~~~~~
    442M    /home/damko/.vagrant.d/boxes/debian_jessie_800_64bit
~~~~~~~

The Vagrant virtual machines will be saved in the VirtualBox default directory (in my case ~/vms/vbox/)

{linenos=off, lang=bash}
~~~~~~~
    ls -lh ~/vms/vbox
~~~~~~~

Output:

{linenos=off, lang=bash}
~~~~~~~
    drwx------ 3 damko damko 4.0K 2014-11-26 16:56:12 ariadne-dev
~~~~~~~

T> you can change the VirtualBox default directory by editing the "~/.Virtualbox/VirtualBox.xml" file. The value is contained in the "defaultMachineFolder" parameter of the "SystemProperties" tag.


Occupied space:

{linenos=off, lang=bash}
~~~~~~~
    du -sh ~/vms/vbox/*
~~~~~~~

Output:

{linenos=off, lang=bash}
~~~~~~~
    1.2G    /home/damko/vms/vbox/ariadne-dev
~~~~~~~
