## Automation tools {#automation_tools_paragraph}

Besides VirtualBox, Vagrant and Packer there are additional tools that can help setting up your virtual environment.

After a fresh virtual machine has been created the additional system configurations can be done manually or with an _automation tool_.

The most famous automation tools (also called _provisioning software_) currently available are [Puppet](http://www.puppetlabs.com), [Chef](http://www.opscode.com) and [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com).

These tools are specifically designed to install any kind of software package, service, script and configuration file. They can be used both on virtual machine and regular computers.

Provisioning virtual machines grants that any other virtual machine created using the same configuration files will be identical to the others and it's the way to programmatically create virtual machines with the same quality. 

This approach is very useful when you work in a team in which each developer has his/her own development virtual machine but also when you strive to have a development environment homogeneous with the production one.

A well configured provisioning tool also gives you the freedom to destroy and rebuild your boxes in minutes or to painlessly switch your hosting provider at any time.

### Automation tools and Suggestotron

The Suggestotron web application, as shown in the [requirements](http://phpbridge.org/intro-to-php/) needs PHP, a webserver and a mysql database to run.

This manual will use Ansible to automatically install and configure the required software both in the development and in the production environment.
