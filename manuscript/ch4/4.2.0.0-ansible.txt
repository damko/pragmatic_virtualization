## Ansible

Ansible is a powerful automation tool that doesn't require custom scripting or custom code or software agents pre-installed in the virtual machine. 

Its simple configuration syntax, the ability to execute commands via ssh without the need of any software agent make Ansible very appealing.

It also doesn't need a database or daemons running and, once installed on your workstation, you can manage an entire fleet of remote machines from that central point.

### Ansible installation

This time it's safe to use the distro installer:

{linenos=off, lang=bash}
~~~~~~~
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ansible
~~~~~~~

Ansible, by default, decorates its output with the funny "cow" ASCII art.

{linenos=off, lang=bash}
~~~~~~~
 ------------
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||
~~~~~~~

It's funny but it's also "noisy" so it's better to disable it with this command:

{linenos=off, lang=bash}
~~~~~~~
sudo sed 's/#nocows/nocows/g' -i /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
~~~~~~~

### Ansible and Vagrant

Checkout the _ansible_apache_php_ branch from the _extra_ repository

{linenos=off, lang=bash}
~~~~~~~
    cd $pve
    git checkout ansible_apache_php
~~~~~~~

Vagrant can be configured to be a wrapper also for Ansible. 

To do so the Vagrantfile has to contain these instructions (have a look at your Vagrantfile):

{linenos=off, lang=bash}
~~~~~~~
# Use Ansible as automation tool
devel.vm.provision "ansible" do |ansible|

    ansible.playbook = "../ansible/ariadne-dev-playbook.yml"

    # Run commands as root
    ansible.sudo = true
end
~~~~~~~

The only variable to take care of is _ansible.playbook_ which says where Ansible can find its own configuration file.
