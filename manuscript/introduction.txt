# Introduction

This manual is a synthesis of my personal experiences with virtualization and doesn't pretend to be considered the "bible" of virtualization.

It's a straight forward and down to earth manual written with pragmatism in mind to provide what's necessary to create, clone, run, maintain and destroy virtual machines, locally and remotely.

Virtualization is a big elephant that can be eaten only in small bites, therefore it's impossible to write a manual that covers all the operating systems and the combinations of software.
This is why I tackled the topic from a specific perspective which has some requirements and which cuts off many of the virtualization technologies currently available but, at least, brings quick and effective results to the reader.

I know that someone will not be happy with this choices but I encourage everybody to take this manual and to adjust it for different perspectives.

## Target

This manual will drive you step by step through the creation of a Debian 64 bit virtual machine which can be used on daily bases as development environment and will show you how to reflect the same environment on a public server.

## Requirements

These are the requirements for your workstation

* 64 bit hardware
* A Linux Debian based operating system

If you have a different architecture or a different operating system you can still use this manual in most of the chances but be ready to adjust the commands to your environment.

## Perspective

This is the virtualization software that will be used:

* Packer to create virtual machine from an iso
* Virtualbox as virtualization environment
* Vagrant as virtualization manager
* Ansible as automation tool
* Digital Ocean as provider for the production environment

While virtualization has many application fields, this manual will stress on virtualization for the development of PHP based web applications.

## Audience

This manual is for those who have never worked with virtualization and for those who are willing to improve their development work-flow.
