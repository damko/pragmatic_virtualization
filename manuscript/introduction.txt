# Introduction

This manual is a synthesis of my personal experiences with virtualization and doesn't pretend to be considered the "bible" of virtualization.

It's a straight forward and down to earth manual written with pragmatism in mind to provide what's necessary to create, clone, run, maintain and destroy virtual machines, locally and remotely.

Virtualization is a big elephant that can be eaten only in small bites, therefore it's impossible to write a manual that covers all the operating systems and the software combinations.

This is why I tackled the topic from a specific perspective which has some requirements and cuts off several virtualization technologies currently available but, at least, brings quick and effective results to the reader.

I know that someone will not be happy with these choices but I encourage to adjust the source of this manual for different perspectives and to re-publish it as a free manual.

## Perspective

This is the virtualization software that will be used:

* Packer to create virtual machine from an iso
* Virtualbox as virtualization environment
* Vagrant as virtualization manager
* Ansible as automation tool
* Digital Ocean as provider for the production environment

While virtualization has many application fields, this manual addresses the topic of virtualization from the point of view of a web developer writing PHP based web applications.

## Target

The main target is the creation of a Debian 64 bit virtual machine that you can reuse as development environment for your projects.

To make the experience more real, the virtual machine will be automatically configured to run the final [Suggestotron application](http://phpbridge.org/intro-to-php/) generously created by [PHP Women](http://phpwomen.org/). This example will show you how to your virtualization tools configuration files to automatically produce a good environment for your applications.

Finally the virtual environment will be replicated and published on a public server.

## Requirements

These are the requirements for your workstation

* 64 bit hardware
* A Linux Debian based operating system
* 5GB of free space
* 2GB of RAM

If you have a different hardware architecture or a different operating system you can probably still use this manual but be ready to adjust the commands to your situation.

## Audience

Anyone who wants to take the advantages of virtualization to improve the development work-flow and those who wants to know what happens under the hood. Beginners included.
