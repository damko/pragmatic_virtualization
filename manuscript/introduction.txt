# Introduction

Any developer must know many things and virtualization is one of those. Unfortunately (or fortunately?) not everybody works in a well structured company with a team dedicated to every single aspect of software development and, because none is a "miracle man", sometimes is necessary to take some shortcuts or to know just what's necessary to get the job done.

This manual is a synthesis of my personal experiences with virtualization and will not cover in detail the theory behind virtualization and will not make you an expert in [devops](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps).

It's a modest and straight forward manual written with pragmatism in mind to provide what's necessary to create, clone, run, maintain and destroy virtual machines, locally and remotely.

Virtualization is a big elephant that can be eaten only in small bites, therefore it's impossible to write a manual that covers all the operating systems and the software combinations.

This is why I tackled the topic from a specific perspective which has some requirements and cuts off several technologies currently available but, at least, brings quick and effective results to the reader.

I know that someone will not be happy with these choices but I encourage to adjust this manual for different perspectives and to re-publish it as a free manual.

## Perspective

This is the virtualization software that will be used:

* Packer to create virtual machine from an iso
* Virtualbox as virtualization environment
* Vagrant as virtualization manager
* Ansible as automation tool
* Digital Ocean as provider for the production environment

While virtualization has many application fields, this manual addresses the topic of virtualization from the point of view of a full stack self-employed PHP developer.

## Target

The main target is to programmatically create of a Debian 64 bit virtual machine that can be reused as development environment for your projects.

To make the experience more real, the virtual machine will be automatically configured to run the final [Suggestotron application](http://phpbridge.org/intro-to-php/) generously created by [PHP Women](http://phpwomen.org/). This example will show you how to configure your virtualization tools to automatically produce a good environment for your applications.

Finally, the virtual environment will be replicated and published on a public server.

## Requirements

These are the requirements for your workstation

* 64 bit hardware
* A Linux Debian based operating system
* 5GB of free space
* 2GB of RAM

If you have a different hardware architecture or a different operating system you can probably still use this manual but be ready to adjust the commands to your situation.

## Audience

This manual is for beginners and intermediate PHP developers.

If you are a beginner and you have been studying (or you mean to study) the [PHPBridge guide](http://phpbridge.org/intro-to-php/) you will find this manual particularly useful. The way this manual is written fits perfectly in the learning pattern chosen by the PHPBridge project.

If you are an intermediate developer but you are not used to virtualization this manual will be a kickstart. If you already use virtualization this manual might help you to improve your development work-flow and clarify a bit what happens under the hood.

## Acknowledgements

Many thanks to:
* [PHP Women](http://phpwomen.org/) for the great job done with the [PHPBridge project](http://phpbridge.org/)
* [phptherightway](http://www.phptherightway.com/) from which I took inspiration and ... some chunks of text :-)

Many thanks to Phil Sturgeon, Lorna Mitchell, Ben Edmunds, Kayla Daniels, Davey Shafik and Erika Heidi. Their constant efforts in the PHP community and their books have been of great help.
