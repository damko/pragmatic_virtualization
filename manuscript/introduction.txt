## Introduction

This manual is a synthesis of my personal experiences with virtualization and doesn't pretend to be considered the "bible" of virtualization.

It's a short, down to earth manual written with pragmatism in mind to help those who never worked with virtualization and those who would like to have a smooth workflow in the production / maintenance of virtual machines.

The final target of this manual is to give to you whatever is necessary to create, clone, run, maintain and destroy your virtual machines, locally and remotely.

Virtualization is a big elephant that can be eaten only in small pieces. It's impossible to write a manual that covers all the operating systems and the combination of software, so I tackled the topic from a specific perspective:

* 64 bit hardware
* linux operating system (both for the hosting computer and for the virtual machines)
* virtualbox as virtualization environment
* vagrant as virtualization manager
* ansible as automation tool
* Digital Ocean as provider for the production environment

I know that somebody won't be happy with this perspective but I encourage everybody to take this manual and to adjust it for different perspectives.

Step by step I'll drive you through the creation of a Debian 64 bit virtual machine 64 bit configured to run a web server and a database server hosted both on your computer and on Digital Ocean.
