## Listing Vagrant templates and vms

You can list the Vagrant template (or "boxes") with this:

    vagrant box list

Output:

> debian_wheezy_770_64bit (virtualbox, 0)

You can also list the Vagrant vms managed by Vagrant with:

    vagrant global-status

Output:

> 4c47439  ariadne-dev virtualbox    running  /home/damko/projects/pragmatic_virtualization_extra/ariadne/orchestration/vagrant

You can also ask Virtualbox to list the virtual machines present in its registry.

    vboxmanage list vms

Output:

> "ariadne-dev" {472a10a0-6958-4e62-9219-54d50bee4928}

*Note:* just in our case the output of the last two commands is equal (ariadne-dev for both) but this is obviously not a rule. There is no equivalence between the two commands.

Of course, you can also use the Virtualbox GUI to list the register vms

    virtualbox

## Where are templates and vms physically located?

The Vagrant template boxes are located on your workstation disk

    ls -lh ~/.vagrant.d/boxes

Output:

> drwxr-xr-x 3 damko damko 4.0K 2014-11-17 20:27:33 debian_wheezy_770_64bit

You can check the occupied space with:

    du -sh ~/.vagrant.d/boxes/*

Output:

> 442M    /home/damko/.vagrant.d/boxes/debian_wheezy_770_64bit

The Vagrant vms will be saved in the Virtualbox default directory (in my case ~/vms/vbox/)

    ls -lh ~/vms/vbox

Output:

> drwx------ 3 damko damko 4.0K 2014-11-26 16:56:12 ariadne-dev

Occupied space:

    du -sh ~/vms/vbox/*

Output:

> 1.2G    /home/damko/vms/vbox/ariadne-dev
