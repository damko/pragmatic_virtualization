## Suggestotron

"Ariadne-dev" is now ready to host the Suggestotron application. You just miss

* the application code
* to create the database
* to populate the database
* to add a virtualhost for Apache

### Get the code

The Suggestroton repository uses tags in the same way this manual uses branches so it's convenient to clone the git repository in your _projects_ folder so that you can browse among tags and follow the step by step [Suggestotron guide](http://phpbridge.org/intro-to-php).

    cd $pve/ariadne-dev/projects
    git clone git@github.com:dshafik/suggestotron.git

### Create and populate the database
